The Odd Duck Product Co. aims to decide their next investment in a new product for sale. They plan to develop a web app running on a kiosk at their campus entrance, enabling employees to vote for one out of three potential products displayed. The app will ensure fair presentation and maintain the products' aspect ratio. To maintain objectivity, the vote totals and graphs will remain hidden until 25 selections are collected.
